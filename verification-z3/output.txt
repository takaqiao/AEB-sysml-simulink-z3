--- AEB Controller Logic Verification with Z3 ---

[INFO] Verifying property: 'The system should NOT apply full brakes when the situation is safe.'
[INFO] Z3 will search for a counterexample where:
[INFO]   1. decel == FBdecel
[INFO]   AND 2. Not(And(If(TTC > 0, TTC, -TTC) < FBtime, TTC < 0))

--- Z3 Solver Result ---
Result: unsat

[PROPERTY VERIFIED!] Z3 could not find any counterexample.
This formally proves that based on the provided logic, the system will ONLY apply full brakes
when the condition 'Abs(TTC) < FBtime && TTC < 0' is met.
